angular-chat
============

Playing with [angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), I want to see how it works.

Using a [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/hCykg/1/) and the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as starting points.

To run it on a web server, install thttpd and

	sudo thttpd -r -d $WORKSPACE/angular-chat/app -h localhost -p 8080 -M 0
