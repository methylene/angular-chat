angular-chat
============

Playing with [angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), I want to see how it works.

Using a [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/hCykg/1/) and the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as starting points.

Run in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as follows (assuming the working directory contains the "app" folder):

	cd app
	node ../server/server.js

The server will run [on port 3000](http://localhost:3000/).
